    <h1>Please Adopt Us!</h1>
        <p>If you’ve never adopted a pet before, you may be wondering, how does the process work? How long does it take? How much does it cost? The information below will help give you an overview of how it works to adopt a pet from the two main types of organizations: Shelters and Rescues. Each organization is different, but it helps to understand the two main types and what to expect, so you can have a better overall pet adoption experience.</p>

    <h2>Charlie</h2>
    <p>  We got Charlie when he was 8 weeks old. He’s timid, nervous. He’s more of a two person family (adults) not great with small kids even tho raised with 6 kids. He’s protective of his kids only. He used to go to daycare with other dogs a few times a week over a year ago. He loves car rides! </p>

         <h2>Sammy</h2>
         <p>  Hi, my name is Sammy.  I am friendly, social and love giving tons and tons of kisses.  I guess you can say that I am boisterous.  I do love to bounce on people and can pull while on leash, so maybe you could help me with these things.  Reach to pat me and I will wash every finger you have. </p>
